---------------------------------------
- Summary
---------------------------------------

Athena-GUI is one of the modules of the Athena Game Framework, in the form of a
library written in C++.

This module provides all the necessary tools to implement an in-game GUI based
on HTML CSS and (optionally) JavaScript files. It is based on the libRocket
library (http://http://librocket.com).

This module can be used as a standalone library, or combined with the rest of
the Athena Game Framework (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Framework).

The use of this module is optional, you can choose to implement your own
GUI solution instead, or to not use one at all.

Additionally, when the Athena-Scripting (http://github.com/Kanma/Athena-Scripting)
module is built alongside this one, Athena-GUI will be usable from JavaScript.


---------------------------------------
- Dependencies
---------------------------------------

Athena-GUI requires the following dependencies:

   - XMake
   - Athena-Math
   - Athena-Core
   - FreeType
   - libRocket
   - UnitTest++

They are provided as GIT submodules of this repository and will be compiled
automatically during the compilation of Athena-GUI.

To download them, do:

    somewhere$ cd <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-GUI>
    Athena-GUI$ git submodule init
    Athena-GUI$ git submodule update


---------------------------------------
- Compilation
---------------------------------------

(Note: you'll need to install CMake to compile Athena-GUI)

To compile Athena-GUI (and all its dependencies), do:

    somewhere$ mkdir build
    somewhere$ cd build
    build$ cmake <path/to/the/source/of/Athena-GUI>
    build$ make

The library will be put in build/bin/
